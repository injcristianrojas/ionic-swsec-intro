# ionic-swsec-intro
Ionic Framework mobile app for SWSEC-INTRO

# Setup

This requires:

* The [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started). For this you will need Node.js. I personally reccommend
the use of a virtual environment for this ([NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)) is a good tool in this sense)
* Apache Maven (and its JDK, at least 1.8)

Steps:

1. Install Node and then Ionic: `npm install -g ionic`
1. Go to the swsec-intro folder and then do `mvn compile`

# Operation

1. Launch the web server going to swsec-intro and `mvn compile jetty:run`
1. Launch the mobile app using `ionic serve`
1. Go to
